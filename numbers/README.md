These shaders are all pretty much the same, and can be used to sharpen white numbers only.

`Numbers_2.shader` -> Cleans up two digits at a time (0-9 only)
`Numbers_3.shader` -> cleans up three digits at a time (0-9 only)
`Numbers_hex.shader` -> cleans up a single digit, supporting (0-9 and A-F)

`Numbers_2.shader` and `Numbers_3.shader` require you to add numbers-white.png to compare against.
`Numbers_hex.shader` requires `numbers-hex.png` to compare against
